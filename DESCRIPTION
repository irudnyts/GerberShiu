Description: A set of functions for computing Gerber-Shui function and a ruin
    probability via Monte-Carlo method. This package allows for estimating these
    risk measures for classical Cramer-Lundberg (a compound-Poisson risk model),
    as well as for its extenssion that includes capital injections.
